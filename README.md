Hi! Thanks so much for stopping by!

This is the repository for my GitHub Universe 2023 session 
**Putting cybersecurity advocacy into action with GitHub Advanced Security**
[SEC1808M](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe23/sessioncatalog/page/sessioncatalog?search=sec1808). 
It contains all the additional information shown in the session. 

### What is this about?

If you haven't watched the session yet, here's a quick explainer: a lot of corporate cybersecurity is asking other people to change. But change is kind of hard[^1].
Corporate cybersecurity teams[^2] can (and probably should) do better when it comes to helping people change. Science can tell us how to do that[^3]! 
In my session I talk a lot about how to put science-based strategies into action by suggesting concrete steps you can take. 

> [!NOTE]
> To make **these steps** super easy to access, I've re-created them as **issues in a project** in this repository. 

You can copy the project to use for rolling out your own change
or you can browse through the issues individually. I've grouped the issues by milestones that correspond to the stages of change and gave them labels to make it 
easier to find what you're looking for.

[^1]: Which is also why generally people aren't big fans.
[^2]: Honestly the concept and strategies probably apply to other contexts as well, especially if your job is to support someone else. I'm just always talking about 
cybersecurity, because that's my area of expertise/experience. 
[^3]: Ok so it can give us a pretty good idea, but (obviously) your milage may vary.
